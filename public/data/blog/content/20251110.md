Hello, Happy Farm blog readers!

With the weather turning cold, how are you managing your dry skin? We're here to share our **farm-style natural mask recipe** that offers deep moisturization without irritating the skin. We'll be using **Honey** and **Oats**.

## ✨ Skin Benefits of Honey and Oats

These two ingredients offer amazing benefits not only when eaten but also when applied to the skin.

* **Natural Honey:** Acts as a powerful **humectant**, locking moisture into the skin. Its antibacterial properties also help prevent blemishes.
* **Oats:** Finely ground oats work as a **natural scrub**, gently removing dead skin cells. The **Beta-Glucan** component is excellent for skin soothing and strengthening the protective barrier.

## 🥣 Ultra-Simple Moisturizing Mask Recipe

Create a mask right now with fresh ingredients harvested or acquired directly from the farm.

| Ingredient | Quantity | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fine Oat Flour** (Not Oatmeal) | 2 tablespoons | Exfoliation and Soothing |
| **Farm-Produced Natural Honey** | 1 tablespoon | Powerful Moisturization and Antibacterial |
| **Warm Water or Milk** | 1–2 tablespoons | Consistency Adjustment |

### Instructions

1.  Mix the oat flour and honey thoroughly in a bowl.
2.  Gradually add warm water or milk until you achieve a thick consistency that won't easily run off.
3.  Apply a generous layer of the mask to a clean face, avoiding the eye and mouth areas.
4.  After 10 to 15 minutes, gently massage and wash it off with lukewarm water.

## ⚠️ Precautions

* If you have sensitive skin, perform a **patch test** on your inner arm before use.
* Since the remaining mask contains no preservatives, **seal and refrigerate** it, and use it completely within 2 to 3 days.
